Solutions for common Cal.com integration problems.

## Connection Issues

### Invalid API Key

**Problem:** Events not loading or sync fails

**Solution:**
- Verify API key is active in Cal.com → Settings → Developer → API Keys
- Ensure key includes `cal_live_` prefix
- Generate a new API key if needed

### Events Not Loading

**Problem:** Event dropdown is empty after entering API key

**Solution:**
- Check API key is correct
- Click outside the API key field to trigger event loading
- Refresh the page if events still don't appear
- Verify you have events created in Cal.com

## Sync Issues

### Sync Event Failed

**Problem:** "Sync Event" button fails or shows error

**Solution:**
1. Click **"Troubleshoot"** button instead
2. This resets all booking fields to correct configuration
3. Verify changes in Cal.com event settings

### Field Configuration Errors

**Problem:** Getting errors about required fields or missing fields

**Solution:**
- Click **"Troubleshoot"** to reset fields
- Only name, email, phone should be required
- All other fields (location, guests, etc.) should be optional

## Booking Failures

### No Calendar Invites Sent

**Problem:** Bookings succeed but customer doesn't receive invite

**Solution:**
- Define `email` variable in [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)
- Pass customer email when creating leads
- Verify email format is valid

### Phone Number Missing

**Problem:** Phone number doesn't appear in calendar events

**Solution:**
- Click **"Sync Event"** or **"Troubleshoot"** button
- This automatically adds the phone field to the event
- Phone number is included after sync

### Booking Time Zone Issues

**Problem:** Appointments scheduled at wrong time

**Solution:**
- Check time zone in Cal.com event settings
- Verify assistant is getting correct time from customer
- Test with specific time mentions during call

## Testing Issues

### Web Call Bookings Fail

**Problem:** Bookings work inconsistently with web calls

**Solution:**
- Use real phone calls for testing (not web calls)
- Web calls may not pass phone variable correctly
- When using web calls, provide phone in international format with + prefix (e.g., "+1 555-123-4567")
- Phone calls ensure all variables are transmitted correctly

### Multiple Calendars Not Working

**Problem:** Only one calendar works or events conflict

**Solution:**
- Each calendar should have different event selected
- Use distinct event names (e.g., "15min", "30min")
- Sync each event separately after adding
