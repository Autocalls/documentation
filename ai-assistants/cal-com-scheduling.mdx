<Check>
The sync configures: name, email, phone (required) + notes (optional). All other fields become optional.
</Check>

## Multiple Calendars

Click **"+"** next to Appointment Scheduling to add more calendars (e.g., 15min, 30min meetings).

## Email Setup

For calendar invites to work:

1. Define `email` in assistant [input variables](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)
2. Pass customer email when creating leads

The phone number is automatically included after sync.

## Troubleshooting

**Invalid API Key:** Verify it's active in Cal.com settings and includes `cal_live_` prefix

**Sync Failed:** Click **"Troubleshoot"** button to reset fields

**No Invites Sent:** Ensure `email` variable is defined and passed with leads

**Field Errors:** Use "Troubleshoot" to reset. Only name, email, phone should be required.

## Testing
